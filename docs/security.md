# Security

What the application does to protect credentials and configuration, and — just
as importantly — what it does not.

## Metadata directory

Application-level configuration lives in a single directory outside the program
tree, resolved at startup:

| Runtime | macOS                                                 | Windows                           | Linux                                  |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Desktop | `~/Library/Application Support/<identifier>/metadata` | `%APPDATA%\<identifier>\metadata` | `~/.local/share/<identifier>/metadata` |
| Server  | same                                                  | same                              | same                                   |

`<identifier>` is the bundle identifier from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Both
runtimes derive it from one constant so that the desktop app and a hand-started
`moka-server` on the same machine see the same configuration.

Placing the directory inside the executable's directory, the static asset
directory, or the working directory is rejected at startup with
`CONFIG_METADATA_DIR_INVALID` rather than warned about. Project content never
goes through this layer: canvases, assets, and run history stay inside the
project directory.

Override the location with `MOKA_METADATA_DIR` (see
[deployment.md](deployment.md)).

## API keys

A provider API key is written to disk only as ciphertext:

```
base64( nonce(12 bytes) ‖ AES-256-GCM(master key, plaintext, aad = model config id) )
```

The model configuration id is bound as additional authenticated data, so
copying one model's ciphertext under another model's entry fails to decrypt
rather than silently leaking a key to the wrong provider.

`models.json` carries no key field of any kind — not an empty one, not a
placeholder. Credentials live in `secrets.json`, which is written `0600` inside a
`0700` directory on Unix.

### Master key

| Runtime | Sources, in order                                                          |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Desktop | OS keychain, then `<metadata.dir>/master.key` (`0600`)                     |
| Server  | `MOKA_METADATA_KEY` (base64 of 32 bytes), then `<metadata.dir>/master.key` |

Neither source has to exist beforehand. When the first credential is stored and
no key can be found, one is generated: into the keychain on a desktop, into
`<metadata.dir>/master.key` (`0600`) on a server. A server started without an
exported key therefore still accepts an API key instead of failing the moment
someone types one — at the cost of landing on the weakest tier, where the key
sits beside the ciphertext it protects and a copy of the directory carries
both. Export `MOKA_METADATA_KEY` for anything beyond a local, single-user
deployment; `moka-server --generate-key` prints a value.

`/api/health` and every `/api/v1/providers` response report which tier is in
use as `secretStorage` (`keyring`, `env`, `file`, or `unset` while nothing has
been stored), and the settings page repeats it next to the API key field, so
the current level is visible without exposing the key.

If credentials are already on disk and no master key can be found, server
startup fails with `CONFIG_METADATA_KEY_MISSING` rather than generating a key
that would open none of them. Starting anyway would produce the confusing state
where configuration looks complete but every generation request is rejected by
the provider.

### What encryption does and does not buy

The honest positioning, and the one the UI must not overstate:

- **It does** keep plaintext keys out of the metadata directory, out of logs,
  out of HTTP responses, and out of exported project packages. With the key in
  the keychain or exported through the environment it also keeps them out of
  backups of that directory; with a file-held key the backup carries the key
  alongside the ciphertext, so that part of the guarantee is only as strong as
  the tier in use. A misconfigured sync client that uploads the directory does
  not upload usable keys unless it also uploads a file-held master key with
  them.
- **It does not** defend against malware running as the same user. Such a
  process can read the keychain entry or `master.key` and can call the running
  application's own API. This is encryption at rest against accidental exposure,
  not a sandbox.

Never describe stored keys as "secure" or "encrypted, safe" in product copy.
Describe where they are and what they are protected from.

### Redaction

Only two derived forms of a key may leave this layer:

- `fingerprint` — the first 8 hex characters of `sha256(key)`, for matching a
  key across sessions without revealing it;
- `masked` — the first 3 and last 4 characters, for confirming in the UI which
  key is stored.

Both come from one module (`src-tauri/src/metadata/redact.rs`); telemetry and the
HTTP layer reuse it rather than formatting keys themselves. Plaintext keys are
never logged, never serialised into a response body, and never included in an
error message.

Rotation replaces the entry for a model configuration and updates `rotatedAt`. Previous
ciphertext is not retained, so an old copy of `secrets.json` cannot be used to
recover a superseded key.

### Where a key is allowed to travel

A key leaves this process only towards the host it belongs to, and the rules
around that are deliberately narrow:

- It goes out on a generation request and on a connectivity probe, which asks
  the model-list address derived from the model's own endpoint. Nothing else
  carries one.
- A probe reports the provider's own complaint, never the key that provoked it,
  and the request log carries the method, the path, and the status only.
- The plaintext is decrypted at send time and lives only inside that one
  in-flight request. Configuration holds ciphertext, the gateway decrypts once
  per call, and the task registry holds no credential at all — polling a video
  job resolves and decrypts afresh rather than reusing the key that started it.
- It is sent only to the model's own host. That includes an address a provider
  hands back for a finished file: it is fetched with the credential only when it
  resolves to the same origin, and without one otherwise, because an image left
  on a third-party CDN is public by nature and a key following it would not be.
- The model's protocol decides which header carries it. It is never a query
  parameter, so it cannot survive in a proxy log or a browser history.
- A provider's failure is reduced to its message: the envelope around it is
  dropped, a credential the message echoes back is replaced with the masked
  form, and what remains is truncated. Some providers repeat parts of a request
  in a failure, and a response must not become a way of reading a key out.

## Recording provider calls

Every rule above says the same thing about prompts and keys: they are not written
down. Telemetry carries counts, durations and outcomes, and deliberately nothing
else — `src-tauri/src/telemetry.rs` builds its one log line out of names and
numbers so that keeping a prompt out of it is not something every caller has to
remember. The log lines go to the console and to a daily file under the `logs`
subdirectory of the platform application data directory; what protects them is
the shape of the line, not the place it lands.

There is one exception, and it is explicit rather than implied:
`generate.debug.enabled`. Switched on, every call that reaches a provider is
written to a directory as the request and the answer that came back — address,
headers, prompt, reference media and body, whole and untruncated. It exists
because an answer that arrived and was the wrong thing cannot be diagnosed from a
line saying the call took nine seconds: the only evidence of what was asked and
what came back was in the two bodies, and both were dropped the moment the call
returned.

It is off by default and it is not a setting to leave on. What it writes:

- **Prompts.** Everything a reader typed, and everything a card on their canvas
  said, in full. A recording directory is a copy of the work that went through
  it.
- **Credentials, masked.** Masking is not a setting and cannot be turned off:
  the header that carries a key is masked with the same `masked` form every
  other diagnostic surface uses, a key in a query parameter is masked, and any
  echo of the key inside a body is replaced. What remains says which key was
  used, which is the half of it a diagnosis needs, and never the key itself.
- **Media.** A body that is not text — a picture, a sound, a video — is written
  beside the record as a `.bin` file of its own and pointed at from it, rather
  than encoded into a document nobody can read.

The protections that apply:

- The directory is the `records` subdirectory of the platform application data
  directory — the same root the metadata directory and the logs are resolved
  from, so the application already owns it — created `0700` with every file
  `0600`. It is not a setting; nothing can point recordings somewhere else.
- Nothing is uploaded anywhere. Recordings are local files and stay local files,
  and an exported project package never contains them: they live in the
  application data directory, which is structurally outside every project
  directory (see "Exported packages").
- Recording cannot fail a generation. Files are written by a task of their own
  after the answer is already in hand, and a disk that will not take one is
  complained about in the log rather than handed back to whoever asked.

`/api/health` reports whether recording is on and where it is writing, so that
somebody who did not switch it on can find out that it is. Turn it off by
removing the setting, and delete the directory: nothing cleans it up, and a long
run with large media in the answers can write gigabytes.

Enable it three ways, in descending order of precedence: `moka-server
--llm-debug`, the environment (`MOKA_LLM_DEBUG=1`), and the configuration file
(`generate.debug.enabled`). All three say whether to record; none of them says
where.

## Exported packages

A project package (`.moka`, a ZIP) can never contain application metadata:

- credential names — `secrets.json`, `master.key`, and any `*.corrupt.*`
  quarantine copy — are excluded at **any** depth in the tree;
- the other metadata documents (`meta.json`, `recent-projects.json`,
  `models.json`, the legacy `providers.json`, `prompts/sources.json`) are excluded at
  the **project root**
  only, so a project that legitimately contains its own `assets/meta.json` still
  ships it.

Because the metadata directory is structurally outside every project directory,
these guards are a second line of defence rather than the only one. The
exclusion rules appear in the package manifest, so an importer can see what was
left out.

What the two kinds of package differ in is whose machine they describe, and that
is personal data rather than a credential. The package of the work — what an
export makes unless asked otherwise — takes the record of the run that made each
generated asset out of the document, so the asset still says what it was asked
for and with which parameters, but not which run answered on which machine. A
full backup keeps those records, which means it carries every prompt this
machine asked and the name of every model that answered, a display name
somebody chose included. That is a choice the export dialog puts to the user, off by
default and saying what it keeps; it is not a leak, but it is a reason to think
about where a full backup is sent.

## Damaged documents

A document that fails to parse is renamed `<name>.corrupt.<timestamp>.json` and
the layer starts from an empty one. Nothing is silently zeroed:

- `/api/health` reports the affected documents with `corrupt: true` and sets
  `ok: false`, which names what was lost and lets the UI distinguish "reset
  because it was damaged" from "empty because it is new";
- a damaged `models.json` or `secrets.json` never causes `open_project` to
  fail. Project work continues; the models have to be entered again.

The quarantine copy is preserved so the user can inspect what was lost. It is
excluded from exports under the credential rule above.

## Known limitations

- On Windows the atomic write protocol fsyncs the file but not the parent
  directory; `std` exposes no equivalent API. A power loss immediately after a
  successful write can therefore leave the rename uncommitted.
- The directory lock is advisory and per process. Two processes must not share
  one metadata directory — see [deployment.md](deployment.md).
- Changing the bundle identifier changes the metadata directory. Existing
  configuration is not migrated automatically; set `MOKA_METADATA_DIR` to the old
  path to keep using it.
