//! The gateway, the adapters and the ingest each have tests of their own; what

//! generation node is scheduled onto the provider executor rather than refused,
//! that the answer it comes back with is filed in the project bearing the run
//! it came from, that an answer from earlier in the same run reaches the node
//! below it, that what the panel showed before a run is what the provider was
//! handed during it, that an ask answered several times over is written back
//! onto the canvas whole, that a cancel arrives at a step already waiting on a
//! provider, that a shot is written down the moment it is placed rather than
//! when it answers, that a run left waiting on one asks after the same job
//! when the project is opened again, that a listener hears a run's words
//! as they arrive and its ending last, that a run asked for past the ceiling on
//! how many drive at once waits with its own record still saying so, that a
//! deployment which says nothing reaches a provider refuses a generation node
//! before the run starts rather than failing inside it, that an answer
//! carrying more than a node can hold is refused whole and filed nowhere,
//! that a generation a provider refuses leaves the node saying what it said
//! before, that an ask answered while the node is already showing something
//! puts the answer beside it rather than over it, and that an upstream answer
//! already on the canvas is read rather than asked for again.
