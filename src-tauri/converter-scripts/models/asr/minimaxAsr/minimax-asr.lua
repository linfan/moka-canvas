-- MiniMax speech recognition: one call, answered with the words.
--
-- API reference:
--   https://platform.minimax.io/docs/api-reference/speech-to-text
--
-- The recording travels as the file part of one multipart request — this
-- service takes the bytes themselves rather than an address to fetch them
-- from — and the words come back in the answer rather than behind a job, so
-- there is nothing to poll: where a job-serving script would have started a
-- job, this one answers whole.
--
-- The answer is asked for in its verbose shape, where the sentences carry
-- their own times and, where more than one voice was heard, who spoke: the
-- subtitle file is those sentences, one cue each, measured from the beginning
-- of the audio that was sent. Where the answer came back without them the
-- words are one cue under the recording's own length, which is what a
-- recognizer that heard one thing has to say.
--
-- The language rides as a header of the request rather than as a field of the
-- form. A room's field is free text, so a value that is no language tag is
-- left out rather than sent, and the recognizer decides.
