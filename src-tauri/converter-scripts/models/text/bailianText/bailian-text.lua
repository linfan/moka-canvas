-- Alibaba Cloud Bailian (Model Studio) text generation.
--
-- Words alone are asked at the text-generation endpoint a configuration names.
-- A question carrying a picture is asked at the multimodal sibling beside it,
-- which is the same service reading a message as parts rather than as one
-- string — and an address that already names the multimodal service is left
-- where it is, since a model that only answers there is reachable without a
-- second setting.
--
-- Which of the two services a model answers at is not something an address
-- says: this platform serves its multimodal models — qwen3.8-flash among them
-- — only at the multimodal service, and answers one asked at the other service
-- with a complaint that the url is wrong. So a question of words alone is
-- asked at the address the configuration names and, when the service refuses
-- it for that reason, the same question is asked at the sibling service rather
-- than the complaint being the answer. A question carrying a picture has no
-- sibling: the text service reads no picture.
--
-- The answer arrives in one document, or in a stream when the service was
-- asked for one. Streaming is asked for in a header here rather than in the
-- body, and each piece is asked for as a piece rather than as the whole answer
-- so far.
--
-- A refusal can arrive as a success, with the explanation in the body beside a
-- code rather than in a status, which reading as an empty answer would blame
-- on the model being quiet.
