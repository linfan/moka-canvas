-- One call makes a picture. The words alone are a drawing, and pictures beside
-- them are what the drawing is built on: this service keeps the character it
-- is shown and draws it again, so a picture travels as a subject reference
-- rather than as parts of a message.
--
-- A shape travels the way this service asks for shapes. A proportion is a
-- proportion here — the room's own list is a part of the list this service
-- names — and a shape stated in pixels travels as the two sides, with the
-- rounding this service computes in; a tier or the `auto` of a request that
-- leaves the shape open travels as nothing, and the service chooses.
--
-- A refusal may arrive as a success: the status of this platform rides inside
-- the answer's own base_resp, so a 200 is read for it before anything else.
