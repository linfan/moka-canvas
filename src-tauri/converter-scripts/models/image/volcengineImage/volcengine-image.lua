-- Volcengine Ark (火山方舟) image generation and editing.
--
-- API reference:
--   https://www.volcengine.com/docs/ark/image-generation-api
--
-- One call makes a picture. The words alone are a drawing, and pictures beside
-- them are what makes it an edit: this service takes the pictures as a list of
-- its own rather than as parts of a message, and each one travels as the bytes
-- themselves so that nothing has to be fetched before the drawing starts.
--
-- A shape stated as a proportion is reduced to pixels — about two megapixels in
-- the same proportion, both sides a multiple of sixteen — because this service
-- takes a tier or a pixel size and has no name for proportions. The base is two
-- megapixels rather than one because the service's own floor is a million
-- pixels of whatever shape is asked for: a wide shape reduced to a megapixel
-- would be a size it refuses.
--
-- Several copies of one drawing are asked for as a group, which is this
-- service's own way of saying how many are wanted: it draws them in one run
-- over the same words, and the answer may carry fewer than were asked for.
--
-- A drawing carries no mark of the platform's own: this service stamps one by
-- default and the request has no field for it, so the mark is turned off where
-- the room states nothing — a picture made to be used in a film is asked for
-- without the stamp it would otherwise be delivered wearing.
