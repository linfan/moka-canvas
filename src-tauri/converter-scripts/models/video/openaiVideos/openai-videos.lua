-- OpenAI-compatible videos: a job is started, looked at until it is done, and
-- then collected from the address the handle names.
--
-- The address a configuration carries is the whole endpoint for starting a job.
-- Looking at one is `<address>/<handle>`, and the finished film is
-- `<address>/<handle>/content`, which answers with the bytes rather than with a
-- document — so what they are comes from sniffing them, and the type the answer
-- announced is a claim checked against the bytes rather than trusted over.
--
-- The pictures a shot is built on travel under names rather than as a list: the
-- opening frame, then the closing one, because the provider does not guess
-- which end of a list is which. A picture that is not one of the labelled ends
-- rides beside them as a reference, which is a different field.
