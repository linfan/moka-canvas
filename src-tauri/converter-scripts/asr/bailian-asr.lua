-- Alibaba Cloud · Bailian speech recognition (a recording, as an async job)
-- Protocol: bailianAsr  Capability: asr

--
-- Workflow. The endpoint takes a URL rather than a file, so a recording that
-- lives on somebody's machine is put somewhere the provider can fetch it from
-- first. Five calls, chained by returning the next one (see the converter
-- protocol):
--
--   1. GET  {api}/uploads?action=getPolicy&model={model}  where to put the audio
--   2. POST {upload_host}                                 the audio, multipart
--   3. POST {configured endpoint}                         submit, file_urls = oss://…
--   4. GET  {api}/tasks/{task_id}                         poll until done
--   5. GET  {transcription_url}                           the transcript itself
--
-- The answer is a subtitle document: one cue per sentence, times measured from
-- the beginning of the audio that was sent. Where that audio sits on a
-- timeline is the caller's business, not this script's.

-- How long one speaker's cue may run before the next sentence starts a new
-- one, and how much of it may say. A recognizer's sentence is often a clause;
-- a viewer reads by the line, and two lines are what fits on one.
