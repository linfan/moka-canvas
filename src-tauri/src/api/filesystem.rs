//! What one directory holds, and where a save lands, for the runtime that has
//! no file dialog of its own.
//!
//! A desktop asks the operating system which folder a reader means. A browser
//! cannot ask anything, and a reader who has to type a path out by hand is a
//! reader who has to know it already — so the listing that stands in for the
//! dialog is served from here instead.
//!
//! What leaves this module by the listing is names and where they lead. Nothing
//! is read, and no question about a file's contents is answered: a listing says
//! what a directory holds and stops there. Two rules keep it that small:
//!
//! - an entry whose name begins with a dot is left out, which keeps the
//!   dot-directories a home is full of out of a list meant for choosing a
//!   project from, and keeps a listing from being a way of reading what
//!   configuration a machine holds;
//! - a file is listed only when its extension was asked for, so a listing with
//!   no extensions asked for is a listing of folders — which is what a dialog
//!   choosing somewhere to put a new project wants, and why the answer then
//!   carries no file at all rather than every file there is.
//!
//! Only the web runtime is served a listing. The desktop one has a real dialog,
//! and a loopback server answering a question nobody there needs to ask is a
//! wider surface than a narrower one for the same price.
//!
//! A write is the other half of the same question, and it is served to both
//! runtimes: whichever dialog named the path, the window holding the bytes
//! cannot put them on this machine's disk itself. It writes only into a folder
//! that is already there, under a temporary name that is renamed into place, so
//! a save that fails leaves nothing behind.
