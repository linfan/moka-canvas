//! The provider executor: one generation step, placed through the gateway.
//!
//! Who answers and how is the gateway's business; this module is the shape
//! that fits a generation into the run pipeline. It adds the three things the
//! gateway has no words for: a cancellation flag per run, because a run is
//! cancelled from the outside while a step sits in the middle of a provider
//! call; a wait for a job that answers later rather than at once; and the
//! splitting of that job into a start and a wait, so the run can write the
//! handle down in between and pick the same job up after a restart.
