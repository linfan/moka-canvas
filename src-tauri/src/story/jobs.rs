//! The story job manager: the record a batch leaves, and the driver that fills
//! it in.
//!
//! One job is one request to a provider answered many times over — a dozen
//! shots, a chapter's worth of keyframes — and the record it keeps is what makes
//! that batch a thing a reader can watch, stop, and ask for again: which pieces
//! were asked for, which came back, which did not, and what the answers became.
//! Only the driver writes a record, so pieces finishing at once do not race for
//! it: they report to the driver, and it decides what the record says next.
//!
//! A cancel is a flag the driver and its pieces observe, exactly as a run's is.
//! It ends the job rather than the pieces of it: what never ran stays queued, so
//! asking for the rest again is asking for the rest and not for the whole.
