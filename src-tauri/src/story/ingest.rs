//! Filing what a story job was answered with.
//!
//! A generation is a file like any other once it exists, so the write itself is
//! the shared ingest's — all registered or none. What this adds is the little a
//! story's answer carries that a node's does not: a name a reader can place
//! ("keyframe art", "act video" and the short id of the batch), a shelf
//! category for the one modality a sniffer cannot settle, and the trace back to
//! the batch and the story that asked.
//!
//! Nothing here reads the document. A job's target names a slot in a story, and
//! the story is the client's: the label is made of the kind of thing that was
//! asked for and not of what the story calls it, which is why a book's
//! characters are filed as "element art" rather than by name.
