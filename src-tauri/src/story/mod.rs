//! Story jobs: a batch of generations told as one piece of work.
//!
//! A canvas run is built around nodes and writing a document back — its record
//! names steps by node and its results are placed on a board. A story's answers
//! land in slots of a story, and one step of a story is dozens of generations
//! at once, so driving them as a run would tie the story room to canvas
//! semantics it does not have. What is here is the smaller machine the batch
//! needs: a record that says what was asked for and how far each piece got, one
//! driver per job, and the same gateway calls a run's steps go through.
//!
//! Nothing reads the document. A job is told what to ask for and is answered in
//! the project's own files; which slot of which story an answer belongs in is
//! the client's to know, and it is the client that writes the story back.
