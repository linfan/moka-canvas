//! The words this application asks a model with, kept out of the code that

//!
//! A prompt written into a `.rs` file is a sentence nobody thinks to look for
//! when the answer coming back is wrong, and one kept under `prompts/` is a file
//! a reader can open, change, and read again without first finding the call site
//! that happens to send it. Every template is read out of the binary rather than
//! off the disk, so the words a build asks with are the words that build was
//! tested with, and there is no third thing to keep in step with them.
//!
//! The web client keeps its own set beside the code that sends it. The two are
//! built by different tools into different binaries, and a template that had to
//! be served to a browser before it could be read would make a prompt depend on
//! a request that has nothing to do with it.
