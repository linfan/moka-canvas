//! Model configuration: standalone per-model entries, model references, and
//! the only view of a stored credential that is allowed to leave the process.
//!
//! There is no provider grouping any more. Every model is configured on its
//! own: a category, a protocol from the list that category offers, the full
//! endpoint address, the model name, a display name, and a credential of its
//! own. Nothing here opens a file. Durability, locking, and encryption belong
//! to [`MetadataStore`]; this module owns the rules that make a configuration
