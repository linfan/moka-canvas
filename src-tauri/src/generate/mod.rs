//! Talking to generation providers.
//!
//! [`models`] is the configuration domain — standalone model configurations
//! and what may be disclosed about a stored credential. [`adapters`] turns
//! that configuration into an HTTP call, one module per wire protocol.
//! [`error`] names what can go wrong on the provider side, which is a
//! different thing from what can go wrong on the storage side: the client
//! recovers from the first by opening Settings and from the second by
//! retrying. [`media`] is where a reference to a stored asset becomes bytes,
//! and where the size and format rules live so that no adapter has to repeat
//! them.
//!
//! [`gateway`] sits above all four and is what the rest of the program calls:
//! it picks the model, merges the parameters, decides between answering at
//! once and starting a job, and asks again when waiting would help. [`jobs`]
//! keeps the handles a started job is polled by, for as long as polling one
//! could still mean anything.
//!
//! [`context`] is the other side of the same boundary: where the gateway turns
//! a request into a call, this turns a node and its place in the graph into
//! that request.
//!
//! [`ingest`] is the last step of the journey: an answer becomes files in the
//! project, each carrying a record of the run and the node it came out of.
//!
//! The types below are the whole generation vocabulary that leaves this
//! module: a request phrased in the project's own terms and a result phrased
//! as bytes with a mime type. No provider field name appears in either, so
//! nothing above the adapters has to know who answered.
