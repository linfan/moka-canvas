//! Turning a provider's answer into project assets.
//!
//! The upload pipeline already sniffs, hashes, probes, promotes and registers a
//! file, and a generated answer is a file like any other once it exists — so
//! this writes the bytes somewhere temporary and hands them over rather than
//! growing a second pipeline that would drift from the first.
//!
//! What a generated asset carries that an uploaded one does not is where it
//! came from: the run, the node, the inputs that travelled, and the parameters
//! that were asked for. That is what makes an answer traceable and what lets an
//! editor offer to ask for it again, so it is assembled here rather than left
//! for whoever writes the node back.
