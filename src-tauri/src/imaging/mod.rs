//! Working on a picture the project already holds, without asking anybody.
//!
//! Cutting a region out, dividing a sheet, resampling and tilting are
//! arithmetic rather than generation: there is no model to choose, nothing to

//! means they still work in a project with no model configured, and that
//! asking twice gives the same picture twice.
//!
//! What these share with a generation is where the answer goes. It lands beside
//! its subject as a new asset, never in place of it, carrying a record of the
//! tool that made it, the parameters it was given, and the picture it was given
//! them for. A tool that overwrote what it worked on would leave nothing to try
//! again from, and a result that did not say where it came from could not be
//! checked against the thing it claims to come from.
