 * is the same machine on every host: the entry opens the dialog, the dialog
 * says what is missing and where a renderer would be looked for, and the one
 * button that would ask for a render is refused with that reason. A real
 * render is not asserted here — it belongs to whatever ffmpeg a machine has —
 * but "no renderer" must never be silent.
