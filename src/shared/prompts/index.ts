/**
 * The words this client asks a model with, kept out of the code that sends them.
 *
 * A prompt written into a component is a sentence nobody thinks to look for when
 * the answer coming back is wrong, and one kept under `shared/prompts/` is a file
 * a reader can open, change, and read again without first finding the place that
 * happens to send it. Each one is imported as raw text, so the words a build asks
 * with are the words that build was tested with: nothing is fetched at runtime,
 * and a prompt cannot depend on a network that has nothing to do with it.
 *
 * The Rust side keeps its own set under `src-tauri/prompts/`, embedded into the
 * binary the same way. The two deliberately do not share files. They are built by
 * different tools into different artifacts, and a template that had to cross that
 * boundary would need a server running to be readable at all.
