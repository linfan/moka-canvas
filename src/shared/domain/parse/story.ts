/**
 * Reading a written answer into the drafts a command takes.
 *
 * The shapes are the ones the prompts ask for, and what comes back is read the
 * way an editor would read it: a chapter without a title is a chapter that was
 * not written, a shot nobody can see is a shot that was not boarded, and
 * everything else is kept, trimmed, and said out loud if it had to be bent.
 * The rule underneath all of it is that a partly-good answer is applied partly
 * rather than thrown away — eight chapters with one bad line are eight chapters
 * — while an answer that says nothing at all is not applied and not pretended
 * about either.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a name, a chapter, or a place. A cast list naming
 * somebody the story does not have drops that name and warns: a reference
 * nobody can draw is not a reference, and a shot drawn with a stranger in it
 * is worse than a shot drawn from the words alone.
 *
 * Warnings are English sentences rather than translated ones, as the server's
 * own problem messages are: they name what the model wrote — a chapter number,
 * a word that was not read — and they are read beside the answer they came from.
