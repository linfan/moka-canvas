/**
 * The telling laid out as a board of its own.
 *
 * Everything the steps made is already in the shelf — the drawings, the clips,
 * the sound — so a board of the telling names those same files rather than
 * copying them, and the words the room wrote are written onto cards of their
 * own. Each card carries the ask the room made of its place, so a reader who
 * takes the work into the canvas keeps the words that were already sent and can
 * edit them or ask again from there; each wire is a relation the telling really
 * has, so a card is joined to what it was made from.
 *
 * The board a telling makes is one function of the document as it stands, so
 * what a test reads and what a reader is handed are the same board; making it,
 * opening it and stepping into the editor are the one call beside that, since
 * they are one thing the reader asked for.
