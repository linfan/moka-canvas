/**
 * Which model each kind of the room's work is asked of, as this machine has it.
 *
 * The deployment's defaults are what a room that has chosen nothing asks, so
 * only a reader's own choosing is kept here: the model the words are written
 * by, the one the pictures are drawn by, the one the shots are filmed by, the
 * one the lines are read aloud by, and the one the score is composed by. Which
 * model answers is about the person at the machine rather than about the
 * telling, so it is kept beside the project rather than inside it, and a
 * package handed to somebody else carries none of it.
 *
 * A place is not a capability: the room reads a telling in places — the one
 * its lines are read aloud in, the one its score is composed in — and each
 * place asks the capability that serves it, so a machine that keeps a
 * composer of its own says so by configuring a music model rather than here.
