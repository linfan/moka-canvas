 * One drawing, as large as the window will take it.
 *
 * The pictures in the room are thumbnails of work a reader is deciding about,
 * so looking closely has to be possible without leaving the step. This is the
 * room's own viewer rather than the editor's preview dialog: that one is a
 * panel of the editor's state — folders, nodes, the canvas a file belongs to —
 * and a frame drawn for a story belongs to none of it.
 *
 * A clip that was filmed in pieces is watched as the pieces: the file that is
 * there is played, and the next opens when it ends, which is the order the card
 * and the finished cut read them in.
