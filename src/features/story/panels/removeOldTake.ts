/**
 * An old drawing let go for good: out of the place that kept it, and off the
 * shelf with it.
 *
 * The place's own write happens first and is the caller's — the card hands over
 * what dropping a take means for the slot it belongs to. What is left is the
 * file, and a file is not the room's to drop on its own: the server refuses to
 * remove anything the document still points at, so the step that took the take
 * out has to have landed before the shelf is asked. That is why the two are one
 * flow and not two calls — half of it alone would either refuse the file or
 * leave it behind.
 *
 * What comes back is the line the picks dialog says under its list: nothing
 * when the file went, and the reason it stayed when it did not. A file the rest
 * of the project also uses is not a failure — the reader asked for this place's
 * copy to go, and that part has happened.
