 * dialog back. A browser cannot ask, and the alternative was a text field
 * waiting for an absolute path — which is a field only somebody who already
 * knows the path can fill in. This is what stands in for the question there:
 * the folders of the machine the server runs on, walked one listing at a time.
 *
 * What it shows is names and where they lead, and nothing about what any of
 * them holds; the listing it reads is the server's own, and the server answers
 * it in the web runtime alone. A path can still be typed into the bar, since a
 * reader who does know where they mean should not have to click there.
 *
 * The choice is the file that was picked, or the folder being looked at when no
 * file was — which is what lets one dialog serve both a folder to put a new
 * project in and a project to open, since the second is either of them.
