/**
 * Marks the part of a picture that may change, and files the marking beside it.
 *
 * Painting happens over the picture itself rather than in a field of numbers,
 * because a region worth repainting is a shape somebody can see and not one they
 * can describe in four integers. The marking is kept as the points it went
 * through, so taking one back is dropping it and drawing the rest again — a
 * picture can be tens of millions of pixels, and a copy of it per stroke would
 * cost more than the strokes do.
 *
 * What it makes is the two halves of an ask rather than a repainted picture: the
 * mask becomes a node wired into the picture's mask port, and the words go into
 * the picture's own ask, which is then one press from being run. Nothing is spent
 * from here, and a reader who wants different words wants a field and not a new
 * painting.
