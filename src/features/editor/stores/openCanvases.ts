 * Which boards are open, kept on this machine beside the project rather than

 *
 * A project holds every canvas it has, and the strip across the top holds the
 * ones being looked at: opening a board from the tree puts a tab up, and closing
 * a tab puts the board down without touching it. What was open is remembered per
 * project, so a project opens onto the work it was left on rather than onto
 * whichever board happens to be first — but the remembering is about this reader
 * and this machine, so a package handed to somebody else carries none of it and
 * opens onto the first board like any other.
