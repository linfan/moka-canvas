 * the animation frame so a drag across the ruler asks once a frame rather than
 * once a pointer event, and every composition carries a generation — a frame
 * the reader has already moved past is dropped rather than painted over a
 * newer one. What the frame is made with, and what about it is only an
 * approximation, is written on the stage itself: a degradation is shown, never
 * silently wrong.
 *
 * The transport row lives inside the pane rather than beside it, so going
 * fullscreen takes the controls with the picture and the same button brings
