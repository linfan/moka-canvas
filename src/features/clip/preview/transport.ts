/**
 * The clock the cut is played by, and where the playing head is followed.
 *
 * Playback is a wall clock and nothing else: the playhead is moved by what
 * `performance.now()` has done since play was pressed, and sound follows it
 * rather than driving it. A room whose audio will not start is a silent
 * preview, and a decoder that cannot keep up is a frame dropped — neither is
 * a reason for the clock to stop.
 *
 * The hook is the only thing that turns the store's `playing` flag into
 * motion: it runs the animation-frame loop, stops at the cut's end (or comes
 * back round when the repeat is on), pages the view along behind the head,
 * and hands the audio engine the same moments. It is mounted for as long as
 * the room is, and taken down with it.
