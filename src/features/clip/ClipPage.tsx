/**
 * The cutting room.

 * cut here, the material its boards made lies on the left, and the two pages
 * stand under the same bar and the same corner menu so stepping between them
 * is stepping between rooms of one workshop rather than between applications.
 *
 * The room holds no document of its own. Which timeline is being looked at is
 * a reader's place (clipStore, remembered on this machine), and everything
 * that changes a cut goes through the command pipeline — entering a room and
 * moving between its timelines pushes history seams, so undoing here never
 * reaches back onto a board.
